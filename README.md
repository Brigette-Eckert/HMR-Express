### Webpack HMR Express server
---
Used as a teaching tool for Hack University students to live code, debug with chrome tools and learn D3

#### Install & run server

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DavideDaniel/HMR-Express.git
cd HMR-Express
npm install
npm start
```

#### Use

1. Write your d3 or javascript code in `src/main.js` or any css code in `src/assets/` ignoring the code at the bottom of the script which handles hot reloading and removal of d3 appended elements.
2. Everytime you save your files, the browser should reflect the changes.
3. If you have errors or issues, slack me.
