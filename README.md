### Webpack HMR Express server
---
Used as a teaching tool for Hack University students to live code, debug with chrome tools and learn D3

#### Install & run server

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DavideDaniel/HMR-Express.git
cd HMR-Express
npm install
npm start
```

#### Use

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Edit your javascript code in `src/main.js` or any css code in `src/assets/`.
3. Everytime you save your files, the browser should reflect the changes.
4. If you have errors or trouble, slack me.

NOTE: Ignore the snippet of code at the bottom of `main.js`. It handles hot reloading and removal of extra d3 appended elements.
